I had literally vacuumed the day before with my old Hoover and then vacuumed again with the new dyson the day it arrived I had to empty the contained 4 times! The carpet looked amazing.

I bought it in 2010 when my German shepherd was a puppy.  We already had a golden retriever and the two together were making more fur than I could handle.  I looked for a vacuum I could carry around and suck up clumps of fur from corners with, and this is GREAT for that.  I do not use the attachments often, but usually just hold the wand less than an inch from my hardwood to suck up fur. Sometimes if there are fine particles I sweep with a broom and use this baby to suck up the piles. I change the bag about every second month, even with only one dog remaining.  He sheds ALOT.  A couple of years ago the hose kinked and began collapsing on itself.  I replaced it with a $26 replacement I found here on amazon and it works better than the original (more sturdy).\\nI love this vacuum because it sucks up hair so well and the wand is long so you can suck up spiders from corners and all other manner of things no one wants to get near.  And then you just toss the bag and start fresh!  I just decided to leave our old one at our second home and buy a new one for this house.  I hope this one lasts as long as the other one has.  From reading reviews I think I have the \"newer\" version anyway, so unless they made more changes I hope to own this one for years to come.  BTW, it is also CHEAPER today than it was in 2010.  That doesn\\'t bode well for construction, but I\\'ll take it unless it proves otherwise.  My first one was around $100, and today it is only $83.  But for the 8 years and still counting I have had the other one, $100 is pretty darn good!!'},\n",

I don't know how to service vacuums so I sold it at a yard sale and bought another vacuum (I can't remember the brand). It cost twice as much and the new one is a piece of crap. The new one I bought is so complicated and has so many dials and the part where the dust is is hard to get out and seems to clog easy.\\n\\nThe hoover tempo is not top of the line, but it's a simple bagged model and I really had no complaints while I was using it.\"},\n",

The only way I could move this vacuum on my carpet was to drag it backwards.  Some reviewers say it's hard to push because it's got such powerful suction.

I haven't had one for a while and the last one was next to useless.  I charged this one, attached the brush and went to work.  vvrooomm!  I was impressed with the way it cleaned up pet hair, and bird seed.  It didn't blow stuff everywhere like my last vac.  It's not too heavy and the handle is comfortable and it feels well-balanced.  It ran out pretty quickly, but the instructions said it would take 2 or 3 full charges to get up the long life it promised.  The second charge lasted longer and the third was bit better.  Still not a long time, but I can get done if I hurry.\\n  I like the little crevice nozzle, but I knew I would lose it so I attached it to the side of the vac with velcro.  That works great!  Just be sure and don't attach it over the air vents.  The filter looks like it will last a while.  I don't know how much replacements are.  It says it will last 6 months.  The attachments are easy to put on and take off.\\nOf course, like all bagless vacs, you have to dump the stuff (messy), and clean the filter.  It needs to be rinsed and let dry before reinstalling it.  4 stars because it doesn't seem to last as long as I think it should.

I use it on wood floors as well.\\n\\nBeing able to see how full it is makes more difference than I expected...partially because it fills up faster than I thought it would.  Emptying it is easy...much easier than changing the bags used to be.\\n\\nDurability seems very good.  We've been using it almost 2 years now, and it works and looks like new.  My last Hoover only lasted 2 years before the motor died, and it NEVER cleaned like the Dyson does.\\n\\nMy son has asthma and is very allergic to cats.  He often can't stay in a house where there is a cat for more than a few hours.  He visited a friend who owns a Dyson.  She vacuumed before he came, and he stayed for 2 days without having any breathing problems.  He was so impressed he mentioned it to me when he got home.  It takes a LOT for my son to notice anything that has to do with cleaning house!\\n\\nBy far the most satisfactory appliance I've ever purchased.\"},\n",

       "    {'reviewText': \"What can I say other than WOW!  I spent a lot of time online looking over and reading reviews on many vacuums.  I personally have owned a Dirt Devil and a Bissel.  The Bissel was my current vac.  It worked great until after only a few short uses the telescopic wand lost all of its suction.  The owner's manual said to clean the filters so I followed the instructions and did that.  After having to wait 2 days for them to dry completely, even by a heater, I finally could vacuum again.  This did not last long.  After about two rooms I noticed that the wand again was losing suction.  This problem has gone on for the last year and I was finally fed up.  I keep a clean house so there is no way my vac should clog this often.  I also have no pets and just my husband and I live here.  After researching the Dyson and convincing my husband that $500.00 was not more than any vacuum could be worth, I got the DC17.  It works just like all the reviews claim.  I can tell, even after only using it once that my carpet and house seem to smell and feel cleaner.  I cleaned the whole house including dusting furniture with it and it never lost a bit of suction.  The canister is so easy to empty and because it is completely sealed it is clean to carry around to the trash can.  The ability to turn the rotating brush bar off makes it quick and simple to go from carpet to hard floors and on the hard floors it did not blow the dirt around the way most other vacs do.  It and it's accessories are made well and seem very solid, unlike the cheap plastic of my previous vacs.  Although the vac is not self propelled it almost seems to pull you along as you use it making it easy to manuver.  I also have older finiky carpet that with previous vacs could only be easily vacuumed in one particular direction.  With the Dyson I can go in any direction with ease.  Many reviews said that using the attachments was tricky, so I went to a local store and played with one to get used to them.  They are simple to figure out.  This is by far a solid vacuum that does what it says it will.  Absolutely worth every penny you will spend on it if you are the type of person that wants a clean house.  Check back for updates as I will let you know down the line how things are going.\"},\n",

It sucks well on bare floors, has a long cord and hose, and has a foot-thingy to change to carpet,  but so do plenty others without the following:\\n\\n1. Heavy. Reviewers say it\\'s pretty small and light but I find it hard to handle.\\n\\n2. Disobeys. Ok, I\\'m being funny but it doesn\\'t turn corners or doorways well. You have to pull on the hose and the minute there\\'s a slight turn, the hose bends all the way and blocks the air, letting out a very LOUD noise that scared the neighbor\\'s dogs.\\n\\n3. The hose is SOOOOO flimsy! My kid\\'s toy vac has a better one. Super thin inflexible plastic. A few more \"bends\" and it WILL crack. Since there\\'s no swivel on it either, it\\'ll bend and crack at the base too.\\n\\n4. The cord doesn\\'t retract (you roll / attach it to the underside). I haven\\'t seen that on the tiniest of vacs in 25 years so I never thought to look for this \"feature\".\\n\\n5. The tubes are flimsy too. When you\\'re using all 3 extensions (standard if you\\'re tall or just, you know, vac\\'ing), any pressure you might apply for a rug or what not bends the tubes.\\n\\n6. The \"air hole\" in the tube won\\'t stay shut. I\\'m not sure what that\\'s even for (suction reduction, maybe?) but I do know I rarely use it and it compromises regular performance. But it won\\'t stay shut! Keeps sliding open from the slightest of touches.\\n\\n7. Everything\\'s a bit \"too\" long, and \"too\" heavy, etc. It feels like it\\'s rebelling against being a compact.\\n\\nSo mostly, aside from the lack of a retractable cord, this vacuum HAS all the features, but they\\'re all POORLY executed so it\\'s awkward to use and will definitely break quickly.

I ended up using an old toothbrush to tap lightly on the filter to shake out dirt (better than hitting the filter against the garbage bin), and if there are dustballs stuck in the filter, to gently loosen them with the brush.

It is bagless and the see-through canister lets you keep track of how full it is and when it needs to be emptied - plus you can literally see the dirt fly into the canister, whirling around like a little tornado.

The vacuum is a bit top-heavy and unbalanced, making it liable to tip over backwards (a real hazard if you've got it on the stairs).

       "    {'reviewText': \"OK, I don't know that I can say it better than the title.  This thing sucks hard-core...  In the good way.  People who have, in other reviews, lambasted the packaging are either suffering from acute illiteracy (the directions for opening easily are on the box, plainly printed in large-font, high-contrast ink,) or severe near-sightedness.  Tonight, admittedly, was my first evening with the vacuum.  I did what I would consider a decent amount of testing by cleaning about half of the floor area of my apartment, including the rough slate-tiled kitchen, hallway and bathroom and a touch of carpeted living room, as well as a basic upholstery clean of the couch...  And let me tell you...  Wow.\\n\\nI am an allergy suffering asthmatic, and have always viewed vacuuming as a mildly unhealthy (albiet necessary) pass-time.  For the first time, ever, I was able to do the deed without breathing in half my own microscopic flakes of shed skin in the process.  A major plus.  The clean state of my massively uneven slate tile kitchen, after a fresh sweeping yesterday, is only the most basic testament to this machine's good design.  This was all achieved properly, without resort to the power brush.  Further, my previous vacuum, a sclerotic 18-amp Herbert dirt-mover, had left so much gunk in my rug that simply sweeping through a bit of the living room filled the dust reservoir almost by itself.  The side-to-side clean is appallingly awesome.  Dust was wicking across the floor to find a home in the guts of Sir Dyson's monster.  I plan on using the upholstery attachment on my mattress, and finishing a full clean of all the carpet in the apartment tomorrow to conclude this honeymoon...  Then, to promptly repeat twice a week for at least a month until I feel clean again.  The only criticisms I am forced to agree with (all of which I've read in reviews on amazon,) are as follows:\\n\\n* The ball is too tall to allow for much low-profile sub-furniture cleaning using the powered brush head.\\n* While the vacuum is quite maneuverable, sometimes the old back-and-forth still serves best...  The ball, in other words, will take a bit of time to get used to, and slows up cleaning for traditionalists.\\n* The power brush head is not wide enough to allow easy cleaning even under the modest overhang of standard modern cupboards, even given the ability to tilt the machine at 45 degrees to angle properly and dodge in sideways.\\n* There is nowhere to put the accessories that didn't come with the vacuum, so one is rather up the river if one would like a mini turbine-head someday...\\n* Use of the wand keeps one upright, but the flat upholstery tool is, umm... difficult to use.  The hose is just stiff enough to drag the vacuum a few feet behind one if one moves too much while captured by the muse of cleanliness.\\n* The vacuum always starts, if not in its locked upright state, with the power bar running.  If one had hardwood floors, I should think one would want Sir Dyson to make account for this.  The activation button is easy enough to toggle, but I'd personally rather turn the brush on than off.\\n\\nHonestly, that is about it.  I'm sure I'll come up with more to dislike over a great deal of time, but this is the first time I've been able to breathe without wheezing after vacuuming, ever...  The air smells clean, and isn't making me sick!  That's a gift well worth the price of a Dyson.\"},\n",

       "    {'reviewText': 'it works, its powerful...if you just want to vacuum the floors and not use the extending \"arm\" this is a great vacuum....but the vacuum tube that you use with the brush etc is reallyyyy short. I could\\'t vacuum the top of the bed without having to pick up the whole thing because it would\\'t reach. I would not recommend this, there are better ones out there.'},\n",
       "    {'reviewText': \"Lot's of spirited reviews over a vacuum cleaner.  After purchasing this Dyson, I have to come down on the side of the positive, and I'm not a Dyson employee.  The vacuum worked better than any vacuum we've ever owned.  My wife even noticed that the carpet felt fluffier under her feet.  It went from a bare floor to a short shag to a thick wool carptet that no vacuum cleaner has ever done a good job with.  Other items of note.  It is quiet.  It can be taken apart to clean (as a tinkerer, I like this).  The cord is finally long enough to do most of the house.  It is plastic, but the plastic seems to be of a high grade, and probably contributes substantially to the lack of weight.  It pushes fairly easily for not being self propelled.  Best of all I can see how much stuff it picks up.  The old Hoover did fine with a new bag, but not so good after that.  Remembering to change the bag was difficult (and ultimately expensive).  Here I can see the stuff in the canister to remember to empty it.  Over all a cool vacuum cleaner.\\n\\nAddition (2-09):  After five years of use, no problems.  No parts breaking or falling off, as some have experienced.  Need to clean beater bar fairly often, but that isn't a real problem.  Sturdier than I thought it would be.\\n\\nAddition (11-14):  Ten years anniversary.  Not a problem to be had.  Never had to replace a part.  The original foam filter still good.  None of the plastic parts broke, as I had feared.  Good product.\"},\n",
       "    {'reviewText': 'This vaccuum really sucks up dirt, and both of my children LOVED it.  It was a joint gift from Santa they recieved today (12/27/11).  Batteries were placed in the product shortly before noon and by 7pm the product had stopped working.  The vaccuum was used as a normal vaccuum all day.  It was the surprize favorite toy of christmas.  It is very sad that it stopped working.  On the off chance its is the batteries I will purchase new ones tonight.  Without the sucking noise and the little pebbles bouncing around to simulate a real vaccuum the toy is just not as much fun and therefore a waste of money.  Overall this toy is worth three stars but had it worked longer (more than a month) I would have easily given it five stars because it really did suck up some dirt and make two children very happy (one six year old and one toddler).'},\n",
       "    {'reviewText': \"These little Dirt Devils are just excellent!  I have had one for years, ordered this one for a friend as she doesn't have an Amazon account and her old one finally gave out.  They are wonderful for spot jobs, stairs, upholstery and such.  I especially like to use them to clean my vehicles.  Their little beater bar is just great.  I would recommend this product to anyone and the price here is right.\"},\n",
       "    {'reviewText': 'I got my new Dyson vacuum delivered today, It was really easy to put together. I had cleaned last night and vacuumed with my top of the line Kenmore. I went over the same carpets with the Dyson today. The results were unbelievable  the \"clean bin\" hit the max mark in the first 15 minutes.  I am rather disgusted with how dirty my carpets really were, and how poorly the Kenmore cleaned for the same money.\\n\\nI now want a Dyson for upstairs and one for downstairs.'},\n",

       "    {'reviewText': 'Great little vacuum, been using it for a couple of months now with no problems.  Wish it had come with a better attachment for thicker pile rugs.  I have 2 dogs that shed a lot and all hard wood floors. This does great and have had no problems with clogging from the hair.'},\n",
       "    {'reviewText': 'I bought this Dyson from AMZN earlier this year.  It does have great suction and the on-board tools are very handy, but there are a number of reasons I wish I had bought something different.\\n\\nFor one thing, it IS heavy for a female \"senior.\"  There is nothing light-weight about this vacuum.  My house is two-story and I have an Oreck upstairs.  I could not carry this Dyson back and forth between the levels.  I showed it to a much younger friend over Thanksgiving and he also thought it was very heavy.\\n\\nNext, it is a pain to use on stairs.  The hose is not long enough and is certainly not very flexible.  I don\\'t think it will last very long and will have to be replaced.\\n\\nThey make much about this ball technology and the ease of getting the Dyson around furniture.  While that might be true, the fact that the ball itself and the suction tube get in the way of most baseboards, under cabinets, under furniture, makes that feature useless.\\n\\nLastly, there are those buyers who have mentioned the amount of plastic on these products.  Dyson has fooled us all with its marketing.  There is very little that is really special about them.  Many of the old names are producing better vacuums and with much better prices and warranties.  Check those out before making a investment in this item.'},\n",
